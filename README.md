# WOMBAT-HMI

index.html
- This is the main HTML page that displays the HMI application. This is outside of the .zip folder to be able to track changes using GitHub. To get the latest version of the HMI application, the code of this index.html should be copied and pasted over the index.html within your own wombatHMI folder.

main.js
- This is the main Json(?) file. It enables the functionality of JavaScript on the index.html page. (maybe, I think) It is responsible for making OpenLayers map plugin work. Also responsible for reading of the wombats.csv file, that contains the information on each WOMBAT robot. (This .csv should be a .txt file, but I didn't go to the extra steps of changing the example code I followed. It might be easy to change it to read a .txt)
